# React + Vite + TailwindCSS + Firebase

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

It also includes TailwindCSS ready out of the box and Firebase with minor configuration.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
